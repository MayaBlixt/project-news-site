# Corona news site

Corona news site project created week 2 in Technigo frontend bootcamp.  

## The problem
Started of the project to make a highlevel sketch in Jamboard with the mobile first approach.
When structuring the webpages I used the boxmodel.
To solve the news card layout to be flexible I used flexbox layout technique and grids. 
Media queries where used to create a responsive design on the site. On desktop sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.


## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
