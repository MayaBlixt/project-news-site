# Corona news site

The ultimate Corona news site project created week 2 in Technigo frontend bootcamp.  

## The problem
Started of the project to make a highlevel sketch in Jamboard with the mobile first approach.
When structuring the webpages I used the boxmodel.
To solve the news card layout to be flexible I used flexbox layout technique and grids. 
Media queries where used to create a responsive design on the site. On desktop sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.
Hover effects added for news card to shake and links to change background color.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.

## Known errors and suggested improvements
 News cards are not flipping as I did not get that feature to work flawlessly. Will added later on in a next version :)
News cards are not positioned in the center in ipad view.
Testing have only been done in chrome triggering the breakpoints not with mobile and ipad devices.
